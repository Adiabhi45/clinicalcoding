inferomedial aspect of both cerebellar hemispheres with signal characteristics suggesting that these are late acute or early subacute and correspond to the infarcts demonstrated on the study performed one day earlier no associated hemorrhage herniation or evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus abnormalities involving the vertebral arteries bilaterally with possible origin stenosis on the right and distal occlusion thrombosis on the left given the clinical context the latter in particular could reflect impacted embolic material from a more proximal source the 2d tof and the cranial portion of the enhanced cervical mra both suggest very poor flow in the distal left vertebral artery as well as throughout the basilar artery and its branches including the superior cerebellar vessels bilaterally which may relate to the embolic event above there is no finding on these sequences to specifically suggest vertebral arterial dissection which in general would not account for the bilaterality of the cerebellar hemispheric findings relatively mild atherosclerotic disease involving particularly the left common and internal carotid arteries with no flow limiting stenosis there is no flow limiting stenosis in the intracranial anterior circulation focal cystic encephalomalacia and surrounding gliosis involving the left frontovertex likely related to previous embolic infarct

when he was discovered to have multifocal infarcts involving the pons and both cerebellar hemispheres in the setting of poor posterior circulation he was admitted to the stroke service in the icu from to neuro following his arrival to the an mri and angiography of the head and neck was performed to better characterize the lesions the studies demonstrated extensive confluent and multifocal infarcts involving the pons and inferomedial aspect of both cerebellar hemispheres the strokes appreared in the context of abnormalities in the vertebral arteries possible origin stenosis on the right and distal occlusion thrombosis on the left with poor flow in the basilar artery and its branches including the superior cerebellar vessels there was no associated hemorrhage herniation or evidence of

your right arm there was evidence of gaze evoked nystagmus he could voluntarily shake is head yes and no in addition to moving the distal aspect of his left upper extremity and left toes occasionally clonus was noted in the left upper extremity a bilateral extensor response was observed cvs the patient was monitored by telemetry which demonstrated chronic atrial fibrillation metoprolol was given for rate control and cardioprotection however minimal doses of the beta blocker were used in an attempt to allow a target systolic blood pressure of to a statin was continued per the patient s cardiologist and pcp aspirin and plavix were not necessary for prophylaxis for his cardiac stents and thus these meds were not started as the appearance of the vessel occlusions and infarcts were suggestive of embolic phenomena from a proximal source a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed due to the technical challenges of the study the presence of an lv thrombus could not be explored there is no comment regarding the presence of asd pfo and vegetations note was made of the irregularly irregular rhythm as noted above following the placement of the peg coumadin was started for the

Patient was in his usual state of health per his wife, he had been having a mild headache for the past few days, but today developed a  headache in the back of his head expressed that he thought he was going to pass out, his wife got him to a chair and he became unresponsive and developed respiratory distress. EMS was called, he was intubated in the field and taken to a Hospital. Upon arrival he was hypotensive with HR in the 40's. outside records indicate that he recieved one amp. of Atropine. CT revealed a SAH in aneurysmal distribution and he was transferred to  for further care.

No drainage. No erythema .  He remains vent dependent at this time.  Peg site is clean and dry.   Pertinent Results:  CTA Head/Neck: 1. Fusiform 5-mm dilatation of the V4 segment of left vertebral artery is most suggestive of a fusiform aneurysm. 2. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage.   ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.  IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with probably preserved left ventricular function. Cannot exclude regional wall motion abnormality due to technically limited windows.   Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Status post right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter placement, with stable appearance of the ventricle size. 2. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage, stable.   Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Status post coiling of the left vertebral artery aneurysm, stable appearance of the extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. 2. Status post right frontal ventriculostomy, with interval decompression of the right frontal  greater than the left. No significant interval change in size of the ventricles. 3.A right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter appears to terminate in the right frontal lobe medial to the anterior clinoid process on the right.   Head CT: 1. Interval repositioning of a right frontal ventriculostomy tube, which appears to terminate within the anterior  of the right lateral ventricle.  There is a new 13 x 12 mm hyperdense focus adjacent to this, just right of midline, which appears to be a focus of hemorrhage. 2. Interval decrease in effacement of the right lateral ventricle. 3. The remainder of the examination is stable   CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of  IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage is unchanged in extent, though slightly less dense. Small subdural hemorrhage is unchanged. 2. Slightly decreased amount of intraventricular blood. Decreased size of lateral and third ventricles since . Persistent blood along the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter. 3. Unchanged diffuse cerebellar edema with sparing of a small portion of the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. Unchanged compression of the fourth ventricles and herniation of the cerebellar tonsils. Concurrent head MRI demonstrates extensive cerebellar infarction. 4. Severe vasospasm in the posterior circulation. Mild vasospasm in the anterior circulation. 5. Questionable mild increase in mean transit time in the superior right middle cerebral artery territory, without a matched decrease in cerebral blood volume. In the setting of vasospasm, this could indicate mild ischemia.  Concurrent head MRI demonstrates no infarction in this territory.   CT PERFUSION : There is a questionable minimal increase in mean transit time in the superior right middle cerebral artery territory, without a matched decrease in cerebral blood volume.   HEAD MRI WITHOUT CONTRAST  IMPRESSION: 1. Evolving acute to early subacute infarction involving almost the entire cerebellum, with sparing of a small portion of the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. Associated herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and compression of the fourth ventricle, similar to prior studies. 2. Unchanged extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage. Unchanged small subdural hemorrhage. Decreased intraventricular blood. 3. Decreased size of the lateral and third ventricles compared to .  Head CT : IMPRESSION: 1. Interval decrease in size of lateral ventricles, with stable effacement of the basal cisterns. The foramen magnum is poorly evaluated due to metallic streak artifact. 2. Stable appearance of external ventricular drain, as well as a focus of high density adjacent to it consistent with hemorrhage which is stable in size. 3. Hypodensity of the posterior fossa consistent with evolution of infarction. 4. Opacification of the ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses consistent with intubated state.  Head CT : IMPRESSION: 1. Slightly decreased mass effect on the fourth ventricle status post occipital craniectomy. 2. Evolving cerebellar hemispheric infarcts. 3. Interval decrease of diffuse subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. 4. Unchanged effacement of the basal cisterns. 5. No new acute intracranial hemorrhage or new acute infarction.   LENIS BLE : IMPRESSION: Deep vein thrombosis seen within both of the right posterior tibial veins and partial thrombus seen within the right common femoral vein and superficial femoral vein. No DVT seen in the left leg.  CTA Head : IMPRESSIONS: 1. Severe diffuse vasospasm in the posterior circulation and mild diffuse vasospasm in the anterior circulation are overall little changed compared to , except to note slight worsening in the now marked narrowing of the P1 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery. The appearance on both the  and current study is new since the admission study of . 2. Progressive confluent low-attenuation throughout both cerebellar hemispheres; while this may represent widespread infarction, as suggested previously, the findings on the MR study of , including the virtual sparing of the pons, are somewhat atypical, and a component of diffuse vasogenic edema is a consideration.  EEG  - : Diffuse encephalopathy, no seizure activity.  : MRI C-spine:IMPRESSION: 1. No gross cord signal abnormality. If there is continued clinical concern for cord infarction, axial T2 and diffusion sequences can be performed which significantly increases sensitivity for subtle cord signal abnormality. 2. Areas of altered signal intensity in the CSF space likely relates to blood products from the known subarachnoid hemorrhage. Incompletely imaged postoperative changes of the suboccipital craniectomy, better evaluated on the brain MRI performed the same day.  : CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1. Expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage. 2. Increased size of the fourth ventricle, likely related to decreased cerebellar swelling. 3. Decreased size of the lateral and third ventricles, which are now slit-like. New subdural fluid collections along the cerebral convexities and cerebellar hemispheres. These findings suggest the possibility of overshunting.  : MRI Head: IMPRESSIONS: 1. No evidence of acute infarction. 2. Decreased cerebellar swelling. Some of the persistent edema could be vasogenic due to vasospasm, and some of it could be due to subacute infarction. Recommend continued follow-up. 3. Increased size of the fourth ventricle due to decreased cerebellar swelling. New subdural fluid collections along cerebral convexities and cerebellar hemispheres, which suggest the possibility of overshunting, given the decreased size of lateral and third ventricles. 4. Decreased severity of upward transtentorial herniation as well as downward tonsillar herniation compared to MRI of .   EEG : IMPRESSION: This EEG gives evidence principally for a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy. There are no clear epileptic features to this. Additionally, the cardiac rhythm is significantly abnormal.    Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to .  The tracheostomy tip is at the midline being 6 cm above the carina. The right central venous line tip is at the level of superior SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Multifocal opacities mostly located in the lower lobes are grossly unchanged. No interval increase in pleural effusion has been demonstrated.  IMPRESSION: Overall no significant change since the prior study including multifocal mostly basal opacity.   CHEST HISTORY: PICC line placement. One view. Comparison with . Multifocal opacities persist. There appears to be slight interval worsening at the lung bases. The tracheostomy tube and right-sided central venous line remain in place. A PICC line has been inserted on the left and terminates in the mid superior vena cava. There is no other definite change.  IMPRESSION: Multifocal opacities with evidence for slight interval worsening at the bases. PICC line as described.  Head CT : IMPRESSION: 1. Resolution of cerebellar swelling and herniation through the craniectomy defect. While small infarcts may be present in the inferior cerebellar hemispheres, the remainder of the cerebellum appears to have resumed normal architecture. 2. The lateral and third ventricles remain small s/p ventriculostomy removal. The bilateral posterior fossa subdural fluid collections remain unchanged.  The right convexity subdural fluid collection is smaller, and the left convexity subdural fluid collection is larger, with new minimal rightward shift of midline structures.    Head CT : Final read is pending at this time.  It was reviewed by Dr.  and is stable.   Brief Hospital Course: The CT scan was evaluated in the ED and it was determined that EVD placement was necessary. This was performed in the ED without complication and was set to 20cm H20 and open. The pt was then admitted to the Neurosurgical service for Q1hr Neurochecks in the ICU. He was started on nimodipine and keppra for prophylactic purposes.  Cerebral angiogram was requested and obtained on  and coils were placed and the left vertebral artery was sacrificed. Post-angio a Heparin drip was initiated and discontinued the next morning.  On  the EVD was pulled back.  eve he had new Afib and required a Dilt drip to be initiated. His ICPs were also high and required two doses of Mannitol.   AM a head CT was done to reassess the shunt which showed the ventricles to still be large but stable bleed. His drain was dropped to 10cm from 15cm.  Over the weekend of  his ventriculostomy drain was flushed as there was air in the line and likely inaccurate readings.  Following the flushing, a good waveform was obtained, and his true ICP readings were .  Mannitol was discontinued. Overnight on  the patient had  isolated episodes of asystole lasting 5-10 seconds.  he spontaneously converted to NSR, and difib pads were placed on the patient.  His code status remained full code.  He was noted to have a fever >101.3 on , and CSF/Blood/Urine cultures were obtained.  A CTA head was done which showed vasospasm in the posterior circulation and mild vasospasm in the anterior circulation.  On  he was taken to the OR for a posterior fossa craniectomy/duratomy as his ICPs remained elevated and there was concern for increased edema due to a cerebellar infarct. He remained stable on . Stroke Neurology was consulted.  On  a CTA was done which showed no change from the  CTA but there was increased vasospasm to the R P1. He was then noted to have rigors. He was brought to angiogram and verapamil was injected. On  he also underwent a trach/peg at bedside and an IVC filter in IR. Decadron was started per Stroke Neurology recommendations.  On  he was again febrile and cultures were sent. Decadron was discontinued.  On  he remained stable and his EVD was elevated to 15cm from 10cm. His blood pressure parameters were liberalized.  On  his neurochecks where liberalized to q4hours and his EVD was increased to 20cm from 15cm.  He had no ICP issues.  Later in the day he underwent a brochoscopy which showed thick secretions and he continued to be febrile.  CSF was sent overnight as well.  On  in the early morning, he was experiencing 4 second pauses which occured approximately 10 times per the SICU staff.  His diltizaem drip was discontinued at that time. On morning rounds his EVD was raised to 25cm from 20cm however he had increased ICP's and the drainw as again lowered to 20cm.  He continued to have pauses and episodes of bradycardia so the SICU consulted Electrophysiology to evaluate him.   patient was evaluated by Cardiology who recommended that patient's heart rate be moderately controlled. They believed that overly agressive management of his heart rate in Afib had lead to frequent pauses and asystolic events. He has at this time tolerated his EVD at 25cm of H2O for 24 hours, but clinically it apeared that he was not tolerating the pressure and started leaking CSF from his posterior fossa incision, therefore the EVD was dropped to 15cmH20.  A CT of his Brain showed expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage. Overnight EEG revealed seizure activity lasting 1-2 minutes therefore Keppra was increased to 1500mg .  On  the patient remained neurologically unchanged. The wound remained dry with the EVD at 15cmH20. On  &  the patient again remained stable without evidence of leakage from the incisional site, therefore it was determined that he did not need to go to the operating room at this time.  His EVD remained clamp for 48 hours and was finally removed on .  His SOC site remained dry and his sutures were removed on .  A Ct scan was performed on  to evaluate for increase in external hydrocephalus and this scan was stable.  We would like a repeat scan in one week.

No drainage. No erythema .  He remains vent dependent at this time.  Peg site is clean and dry.   Pertinent Results:  CTA Head/Neck: 1. Fusiform 5-mm dilatation of the V4 segment of left vertebral artery is most suggestive of a fusiform aneurysm. 2. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage.   ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.  IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with probably preserved left ventricular function. Cannot exclude regional wall motion abnormality due to technically limited windows.   Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Status post right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter placement, with stable appearance of the ventricle size. 2. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage, stable.   Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Status post coiling of the left vertebral artery aneurysm, stable appearance of the extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. 2. Status post right frontal ventriculostomy, with interval decompression of the right frontal  greater than the left. No significant interval change in size of the ventricles. 3.A right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter appears to terminate in the right frontal lobe medial to the anterior clinoid process on the right.   Head CT: 1. Interval repositioning of a right frontal ventriculostomy tube, which appears to terminate within the anterior  of the right lateral ventricle.  There is a new 13 x 12 mm hyperdense focus adjacent to this, just right of midline, which appears to be a focus of hemorrhage. 2. Interval decrease in effacement of the right lateral ventricle. 3. The remainder of the examination is stable   CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of  IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage is unchanged in extent, though slightly less dense. Small subdural hemorrhage is unchanged. 2. Slightly decreased amount of intraventricular blood. Decreased size of lateral and third ventricles since . Persistent blood along the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter. 3. Unchanged diffuse cerebellar edema with sparing of a small portion of the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. Unchanged compression of the fourth ventricles and herniation of the cerebellar tonsils. Concurrent head MRI demonstrates extensive cerebellar infarction. 4. Severe vasospasm in the posterior circulation. Mild vasospasm in the anterior circulation. 5. Questionable mild increase in mean transit time in the superior right middle cerebral artery territory, without a matched decrease in cerebral blood volume. In the setting of vasospasm, this could indicate mild ischemia.  Concurrent head MRI demonstrates no infarction in this territory.   CT PERFUSION : There is a questionable minimal increase in mean transit time in the superior right middle cerebral artery territory, without a matched decrease in cerebral blood volume.   HEAD MRI WITHOUT CONTRAST  IMPRESSION: 1. Evolving acute to early subacute infarction involving almost the entire cerebellum, with sparing of a small portion of the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. Associated herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and compression of the fourth ventricle, similar to prior studies. 2. Unchanged extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage. Unchanged small subdural hemorrhage. Decreased intraventricular blood. 3. Decreased size of the lateral and third ventricles compared to .  Head CT : IMPRESSION: 1. Interval decrease in size of lateral ventricles, with stable effacement of the basal cisterns. The foramen magnum is poorly evaluated due to metallic streak artifact. 2. Stable appearance of external ventricular drain, as well as a focus of high density adjacent to it consistent with hemorrhage which is stable in size. 3. Hypodensity of the posterior fossa consistent with evolution of infarction. 4. Opacification of the ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses consistent with intubated state.  Head CT : IMPRESSION: 1. Slightly decreased mass effect on the fourth ventricle status post occipital craniectomy. 2. Evolving cerebellar hemispheric infarcts. 3. Interval decrease of diffuse subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. 4. Unchanged effacement of the basal cisterns. 5. No new acute intracranial hemorrhage or new acute infarction.   LENIS BLE : IMPRESSION: Deep vein thrombosis seen within both of the right posterior tibial veins and partial thrombus seen within the right common femoral vein and superficial femoral vein. No DVT seen in the left leg.  CTA Head : IMPRESSIONS: 1. Severe diffuse vasospasm in the posterior circulation and mild diffuse vasospasm in the anterior circulation are overall little changed compared to , except to note slight worsening in the now marked narrowing of the P1 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery. The appearance on both the  and current study is new since the admission study of . 2. Progressive confluent low-attenuation throughout both cerebellar hemispheres; while this may represent widespread infarction, as suggested previously, the findings on the MR study of , including the virtual sparing of the pons, are somewhat atypical, and a component of diffuse vasogenic edema is a consideration.  EEG  - : Diffuse encephalopathy, no seizure activity.  : MRI C-spine:IMPRESSION: 1. No gross cord signal abnormality. If there is continued clinical concern for cord infarction, axial T2 and diffusion sequences can be performed which significantly increases sensitivity for subtle cord signal abnormality. 2. Areas of altered signal intensity in the CSF space likely relates to blood products from the known subarachnoid hemorrhage. Incompletely imaged postoperative changes of the suboccipital craniectomy, better evaluated on the brain MRI performed the same day.  : CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1. Expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage. 2. Increased size of the fourth ventricle, likely related to decreased cerebellar swelling. 3. Decreased size of the lateral and third ventricles, which are now slit-like. New subdural fluid collections along the cerebral convexities and cerebellar hemispheres. These findings suggest the possibility of overshunting.  : MRI Head: IMPRESSIONS: 1. No evidence of acute infarction. 2. Decreased cerebellar swelling. Some of the persistent edema could be vasogenic due to vasospasm, and some of it could be due to subacute infarction. Recommend continued follow-up. 3. Increased size of the fourth ventricle due to decreased cerebellar swelling. New subdural fluid collections along cerebral convexities and cerebellar hemispheres, which suggest the possibility of overshunting, given the decreased size of lateral and third ventricles. 4. Decreased severity of upward transtentorial herniation as well as downward tonsillar herniation compared to MRI of .   EEG : IMPRESSION: This EEG gives evidence principally for a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy. There are no clear epileptic features to this. Additionally, the cardiac rhythm is significantly abnormal.    Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to .  The tracheostomy tip is at the midline being 6 cm above the carina. The right central venous line tip is at the level of superior SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Multifocal opacities mostly located in the lower lobes are grossly unchanged. No interval increase in pleural effusion has been demonstrated.  IMPRESSION: Overall no significant change since the prior study including multifocal mostly basal opacity.   CHEST HISTORY: PICC line placement. One view. Comparison with . Multifocal opacities persist. There appears to be slight interval worsening at the lung bases. The tracheostomy tube and right-sided central venous line remain in place. A PICC line has been inserted on the left and terminates in the mid superior vena cava. There is no other definite change.  IMPRESSION: Multifocal opacities with evidence for slight interval worsening at the bases. PICC line as described.  Head CT : IMPRESSION: 1. Resolution of cerebellar swelling and herniation through the craniectomy defect. While small infarcts may be present in the inferior cerebellar hemispheres, the remainder of the cerebellum appears to have resumed normal architecture. 2. The lateral and third ventricles remain small s/p ventriculostomy removal. The bilateral posterior fossa subdural fluid collections remain unchanged.  The right convexity subdural fluid collection is smaller, and the left convexity subdural fluid collection is larger, with new minimal rightward shift of midline structures.    Head CT : Final read is pending at this time.  It was reviewed by Dr.  and is stable.   Brief Hospital Course: The CT scan was evaluated in the ED and it was determined that EVD placement was necessary. This was performed in the ED without complication and was set to 20cm H20 and open. The pt was then admitted to the Neurosurgical service for Q1hr Neurochecks in the ICU. He was started on nimodipine and keppra for prophylactic purposes.  Cerebral angiogram was requested and obtained on  and coils were placed and the left vertebral artery was sacrificed. Post-angio a Heparin drip was initiated and discontinued the next morning.  On  the EVD was pulled back.  eve he had new Afib and required a Dilt drip to be initiated. His ICPs were also high and required two doses of Mannitol.   AM a head CT was done to reassess the shunt which showed the ventricles to still be large but stable bleed. His drain was dropped to 10cm from 15cm.  Over the weekend of  his ventriculostomy drain was flushed as there was air in the line and likely inaccurate readings.  Following the flushing, a good waveform was obtained, and his true ICP readings were .  Mannitol was discontinued. Overnight on  the patient had  isolated episodes of asystole lasting 5-10 seconds.  he spontaneously converted to NSR, and difib pads were placed on the patient.  His code status remained full code.  He was noted to have a fever >101.3 on , and CSF/Blood/Urine cultures were obtained.  A CTA head was done which showed vasospasm in the posterior circulation and mild vasospasm in the anterior circulation.  On  he was taken to the OR for a posterior fossa craniectomy/duratomy as his ICPs remained elevated and there was concern for increased edema due to a cerebellar infarct. He remained stable on . Stroke Neurology was consulted.  On  a CTA was done which showed no change from the  CTA but there was increased vasospasm to the R P1. He was then noted to have rigors. He was brought to angiogram and verapamil was injected. On  he also underwent a trach/peg at bedside and an IVC filter in IR. Decadron was started per Stroke Neurology recommendations.  On  he was again febrile and cultures were sent. Decadron was discontinued.  On  he remained stable and his EVD was elevated to 15cm from 10cm. His blood pressure parameters were liberalized.  On  his neurochecks where liberalized to q4hours and his EVD was increased to 20cm from 15cm.  He had no ICP issues.  Later in the day he underwent a brochoscopy which showed thick secretions and he continued to be febrile.  CSF was sent overnight as well.  On  in the early morning, he was experiencing 4 second pauses which occured approximately 10 times per the SICU staff.  His diltizaem drip was discontinued at that time. On morning rounds his EVD was raised to 25cm from 20cm however he had increased ICP's and the drainw as again lowered to 20cm.  He continued to have pauses and episodes of bradycardia so the SICU consulted Electrophysiology to evaluate him.   patient was evaluated by Cardiology who recommended that patient's heart rate be moderately controlled. They believed that overly agressive management of his heart rate in Afib had lead to frequent pauses and asystolic events. He has at this time tolerated his EVD at 25cm of H2O for 24 hours, but clinically it apeared that he was not tolerating the pressure and started leaking CSF from his posterior fossa incision, therefore the EVD was dropped to 15cmH20.  A CT of his Brain showed expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage. Overnight EEG revealed seizure activity lasting 1-2 minutes therefore Keppra was increased to 1500mg .  On  the patient remained neurologically unchanged. The wound remained dry with the EVD at 15cmH20. On  &  the patient again remained stable without evidence of leakage from the incisional site, therefore it was determined that he did not need to go to the operating room at this time.  His EVD remained clamp for 48 hours and was finally removed on .  His SOC site remained dry and his sutures were removed on .  A Ct scan was performed on  to evaluate for increase in external hydrocephalus and this scan was stable.  We would like a repeat scan in one week.
